# JS Project - Comments Feature
This project is a simple web application that demonstrates a comments functionality using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to post comments, reply to comments, edit comments, delete comments, and report comments. The project is structured as a single-page application with an index.html file as the entry point.

## Project Structure
The project contains the following files:

- index.html: This file serves as the main HTML structure of the web application. It includes the necessary HTML elements to display the post, comments, and comment form.

- style.css: This file contains the CSS styles that define the appearance of the web application. It is used to style the post, comments, comment form, and dialog boxes.

- main-functions.js: This JavaScript file contains the main functions that handle the comments functionality. It includes functions for posting comments, replying to comments, editing comments, deleting comments, and reporting comments.

- fetch-comments.js: This JavaScript file contains a function that simulates fetching comments from a server. It is used to populate the comments section with initial comments.

- script.js: This JavaScript file serves as the entry point for the application. It initializes the application by calling the necessary functions and event listeners.

- assets/: This directory contains the images used in the project, such as the post image and icon images for the comment actions.

## Getting Started
To run the project, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The web application will be displayed, and you can interact with the comment functionality by posting comments, replying to comments, editing comments, deleting comments, and reporting comments.
